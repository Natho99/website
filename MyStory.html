	<p>Social media and the internet have made this world a smaller place to live in. We meet all different kinds of people online, doing all kinds of jobs, and living very different lives. </p>
    <p>Being a software developer, I have met a number of talented programmers online. Their achievements and success stories are enough to either motivate you or intimidate you. Some of these programmers even started programming at the age of 6! When I found that out, I immediately thought, &#34That is not what happens in my country.&#34</p>
    
    <p>In Kenya, there is not a culture of doing what your heart desires. The truth is that children are not groomed to decide for themselves what career they want. Instead, the culture is to follow what is in trend. </p>
    
    <p>Half the computer developers in Kenya exist because computer science is trendy, not because it is their passion. That is the reason why children are not motivated to start early. </p>
    <p>I was a bit different, though. Hearing stories of programmers starting young motivated me. There are two ways to take success stories like these: </p>
    <p>1.You could be intimidated </p>
    <p>OR </p>
    <p>2. You could be inspired </p>
    
    <p>I chose the latter, and as Robert Frost said, &#34that has made all the difference.&#34 Seeing successful developers lit a fire inside me to be like them, not run away from them. </p>
    
    <p>There is a lot of power in other peoples journeys to becoming a coder you can learn about perseverance, diligence, and motivation. Reading about another persons approach to a problem can offer you unique tools to deal with a similar situation. </p>
    <p>Let me share with you my story of becoming a coder. This way, I can hopefully inspire you to learn from not only my mistakes, but also from my subsequent smart decisions. </p>
    <p>I was 13 years old when I knew I wanted to be a computer engineer (that is what it is called in Kenya). A computer engineer is someone who is initially taught about all the fields of engineering and then gets taught about computers. </p>
    <p>Pretty confusing, right? Well, that is just how it goes in Kenya. </p>
    
    <p>The only problem was that I did not know how to start. I did not have a clue, and I did not even think to Google it. I simply did what everyone else was doing, then, I would start to study computers. </p>
    
    <p>To be completely honest, I did not even know what programming was back then </p>
    <p>Upon reflection, there is so much I would change about that time if I had the chance. The first thing would be my decision to study endlessly for computer related subjects at primary school, rather than focus my energy and efforts on studying what I was planning to do for the rest of my life: programming. </p>
    
    <p>Here is the first thing you can learn from my story: Always keep an eye on your actual goals, what you really want, not what you guess might get you there. You might not even know how to reach your goals, but in this day and age, lack of guidance should not be an excuse. With the internet at your disposal and your mind set on a goal, you can aim straight at the bulls eye </p>
    
    <p>I still remember my first computer programming class at Kenyatta University where we were given a simple C++ code to write: </p>
    
    <p>Problem no. 1: What is this codeblocks? </p>
    <p>Problem no. 2: What is this cin>>? </p>
    <p>Problem no. 3: What is C++ again? </p>
    <p>Half of my class had a background in IT, As a result, they easily wrote the code that was given to us, while the other half, including me, was left with blank faces. We did not have a clue of what was going on in the class. </p>
    I had never been so embarrassed in my life. </p>
    
    
    <p>You, too, will face similar situations in your coding career. Inevitably, there will come a day when someone else will know something you do not. It might cost you your pride. It might cost you a promotion. It might even cost you your job. </p>
    
    <p>But what you do after such debacles is what is truly important. </p>
    <p>The next day, I typed into the YouTube search box the following query: &#34C++ for beginners.&#34 I found a course by the NewBoston and spent the next couple of days locked in my room learning the basics. </p>
    
    <p>I will not lie, it was hard. It was like nothing I had ever done before, but all I knew was that I had to do it. Classmates of mine had an advantage over me, and I knew I had a long way to go. That actually became the fuel for me to start studying, hard and fast. </p>
    
    
    <p>What got me so far? What got the guy who could not press a single key on his first day in class to a position much better than any of his peers? I can break it down into three important things: hard work (you will not succeed without it), grit, and what made the real difference consistency. </p>
    <p>Now, I cannot stress this enough: The most important tool for success in your coding career is consistency. You might be super talented or work super hard for a month or two, but if you really want to greatly increase your chances of success, then work consistently day after day, month after month. </p>
    
    <p>Those two years that my classmates had on me were gone by the end of college because I had a stronger hustle and stayed consistent. Now, it is not just about those two years this was just an example. As I told you, I have met people who started programming at age 6! </p>
    
    <p>It is great if you start early, and I would surely recommend that everybody choose their path early and focus on it. However, there are great developers who started off in their 30s and even 40s. While I know programmers who started at age 6, I have also met programmers who started at 37 and are doing much better than the ones with years of formal education. </p>
    
    <p>Having not started very early myself, all I have got to tell you about starting late is that it is okay, and that you are in a field where your age does not matter. </p>
    
    <p>It never will, as long as you are consistent. </p>
    
    <p>Do not feel overwhelmed by people the same age as you who have more experience; it is not the end of the world. You can be inspired by them, but do not let their success intimidate you. Maybe they were early, but that does not mean you are late. The truth is, it is never too late. </p>
    
    
    
    <p>Learning Is a Never-Ending Process </p>
    
    <p>A quote attributed to various people over the years is &#34Learn from the mistakes of others. You cannot live long enough to make them all yourself!&#34 </p>
    
    <p>It might be tongue-in-cheek, but that does not mean it is not true. There is a lot to learn from mistakes, our own as well as others. Each story can be an inspiration to rethink our priorities or refocus our efforts. </p>
    
    <p>The embarrassment of an error lasts only for a few seconds. Learning from it can be forever. </p>
    
    <p>Reading stories is great, is not it? You know what is even better? Creating your own. Just remember that you will not have a success story overnight or in a couple of weeks it will take time and a whole lot of hard work. But trust me when I tell you this, The juice is worth the squeeze&#34 at the end. </p>
