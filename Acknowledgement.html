<p> I thank my younger self for focusing on the goal and not the hurdles. I thank my younger self for believing in himself when no one else did.</p>
<p> I am what I made of myself and for that, I thank myself the most. </p>
<p> But no matter how self-sufficient I was. I thank my father for making these hands strong enough to be able to pursue all the tough moments. </p>
<p>  I could not achieve anything without the loving and unconditional support of my mother who never left my side even when things did not make sense to her the way she knows them. </p>
<p>  I am so appreciative to have the loyal, supportive, and caring siblings that I do. I thank my dearest friends for understanding my lifestyle and never forcing me to be someone I was not. </p>
<p> I thank all my teachers and mentors for guiding me on the right path. </p>

<p> Thank you! </p>
